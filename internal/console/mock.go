// The fabricated node, for looking at the graphical dashboard's design without
// a cluster: `vates-dashboard --gui --mock`.
//
// It is written as the API writes it and unmarshalled, rather than built as Go
// literals: the Kubernetes objects use anonymous structs with json tags, and an
// anonymous struct built by hand is a different type from the one declared next
// to it. Going through the wire format also cannot drift from the shape the API
// actually sends.
//
// The numbers are deliberately round and obviously illustrative. A mock that
// imitates one machine well enough to be mistaken for it stops being a mock.

// mockSnapshot returns the fabricated node, with enough events to overflow the

// the reader scrolls up -- cannot be judged in a list that fits.
//
// The node is NOT ready, and its state is the long form -- "NotReady
// (KubeletNotReady)", which is what a control plane shows while its kubelet is
// still coming up. That is the longest value the tiles ever carry, and the one
// that made the grid wider than a narrow console: a mock whose values are all
// short cannot show that, and a mock that cannot show the fault cannot catch
// it.
// mockSeen counts the fabricated events handed out since the process started,
// and mockBase is the instant they are counted from.
//
// The base is fixed at the first call on purpose. This used to stamp every event
// from "now" on every refresh: the whole feed then had new keys twice a second,
// the display's anchoring had nothing to hold on to, and a reader who had
// scrolled up watched lines change under them -- a mock that LOOKS like the bug
// it is supposed to help find. With a fixed base, an event keeps its identity
// from one refresh to the next, exactly as a real one does: the window slides by
// one, and what was under the reader stays there.

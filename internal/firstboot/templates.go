// The YAML documents this package produces are embedded rather than built with
// fmt.Sprintf in Go string literals.
//
// Two reasons. They stay readable: a manifest can be reviewed, diffed and
// compared against upstream's own example as YAML, which is how the kube-vip
// environment variable names were checked in the first place. And they stay
// correct: a template that references a field the data does not have is a parse
// error at startup, not a document with a blank in it.
//
//go:embed templates/*.tmpl

// templates is parsed once, at package initialisation. The files are embedded,
// so a malformed template is a defect in the build rather than a condition that
// can arise at runtime -- which is why template.Must is appropriate here and
// would not be for anything read from disk.

	template.New("vates").ParseFS(templateFS, "templates/*.tmpl"))

// render executes an embedded template.

// The manifest is the flannel v0.26.1 release, embedded in the binary rather
// than fetched when a node first comes up: it is an artifact of the OS image, and
// a control plane has to be able to start with no outbound access.
//
// Two things differ from upstream, both noted at the top of the template: the pod
// network comes from vates-node.yaml, and the CNI plugin image is pinned to the
// version this image already stages into /opt/cni/bin -- upstream ships an older
// one there, and letting the DaemonSet install it would silently replace the
// staged binary with a different version.
//
// The image references pass through the configured mirrors, so a cluster that
// pulls from a local registry pulls flannel from there too. Without a mirror
// configured this is the identity, and the manifest is byte-for-byte what it
// was before the feature existed.
